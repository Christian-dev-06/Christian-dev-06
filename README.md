## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--

My name is Christian and my intended major is Computer Science.

I am currently working on two personal projects. The first is my Youtube channel that I started a little over a month ago. A good chunk of my time goes towards playing videogames so I thought that I might as well try my hand at content creation. I'm only posting clips currently, as I don't have the processing power for longer form videos.

My second project is to learn how to build videogames. I'm quite far away from reaching that goal (Godot is too much for me to handle), but I'm hoping that by the time I recieve my diploma, I'll have enough knowledge to achieve that goal.
